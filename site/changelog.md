## [Unreleased]

### üöÄ Major Features

#### Search Hints for Enhanced File Filtering
- **New search hints syntax**: Filter search results by file properties using intuitive syntax like `ext:rs`, `file:src/*, `dir:tests`, `type:javascript`, `lang:python`
- **Early pipeline filtering**: Filters are applied at the file discovery level for improved performance and precision
- **Multiple filter support**: Combine multiple hints like `ext:rs,js AND dir:src AND type:javascript`
- **Glob pattern support**: Use patterns like `file:src/**/*.rs` for complex path matching
- **AST integration**: Filters are extracted from queries and applied without affecting content search logic
- **Comprehensive testing**: 13+ unit tests covering all filter types and combinations
- **Full documentation**: Updated CLI help, README, and site documentation with examples and reference tables

#### Enhanced Extract Command Markdown Robustness
- **Markdown formatting support**: Extract command now handles markdown bold (`**text**`), italic (`*text*`), strikethrough (`~~text~~`), and code blocks (```text```)
- **Flexible file path detection**: Improved regex patterns recognize file paths after punctuation and markdown symbols
- **Real-world compatibility**: Works with GitHub issues, documentation, chat messages, and other markdown-formatted content
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: 14 unit tests covering all markdown scenarios and edge cases
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved while adding robustness

#### Cross-Platform Claude Code Backend Detection
