# Introducing LSP Integration: Advanced Code Intelligence for Probe

We're excited to announce a major enhancement to Probe: **full Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration**. This powerful feature brings IDE-level code intelligence to Probe's command-line interface, enabling deeper code analysis and understanding across multiple programming languages.

## What is LSP?

The Language Server Protocol, originally developed by Microsoft for Visual Studio Code, provides a standard way for tools to communicate with language-specific servers that understand code semantics. This means Probe can now leverage the same powerful analysis engines that power modern IDEs.

## Key Features

### 🔍 Call Hierarchy Analysis

One of the most powerful features is call hierarchy analysis. When extracting code with Probe, you can now see:

- **Incoming Calls**: Which functions call the target function
- **Outgoing Calls**: Which functions the target calls

```bash
# Extract a function with full call hierarchy
probe extract src/main.rs#calculate_result --lsp

# Output includes:
# LSP Information:
#   Incoming Calls:
#     - main (file:///src/main.rs:10)
#     - test_calculate (file:///src/tests.rs:25)
#   Outgoing Calls:
#     - perform_calculation (file:///src/main.rs:50)
#     - apply_modifier (file:///src/main.rs:60)
```

This is invaluable for understanding code dependencies and impact analysis when refactoring.

### ⚡ Auto-Initialization & Zero-Configuration Setup

**New in latest updates**: LSP integration now features complete auto-initialization:

- **No manual daemon management** required - daemon auto-starts with `--lsp` flag
- **Transparent setup** - works out of the box without configuration
- **Nested workspace discovery** - automatically finds all project workspaces
- **Smart initialization order** - prevents infinite loops with LSP commands

```bash
# These commands automatically start the daemon if needed:
probe extract src/main.rs#main --lsp
probe search "authenticate" --lsp
```

### 🚀 High-Performance Daemon Architecture with Persistent Cache

We've implemented a sophisticated daemon architecture that delivers **250,000x performance improvements** with a revolutionary **persistent cache system**:

#### Three-Layer Cache Architecture
- **L1 Memory Cache**: Ultra-fast in-memory storage for hot data (<1ms access)
- **L2 Persistent Cache**: Survives daemon restarts using sled database (1-5ms access)
- **L3 LSP Servers**: Language server computation only on cache miss (100ms-10s)

#### Advanced Features
- **Content-addressed caching** with MD5-based cache invalidation  
- **Universal compatibility** works in CI, Docker, and non-git environments
- **Maintains server pools** for each language
- **Reuses warm servers** for instant responses
- **Handles concurrent requests** efficiently
- **Manages server lifecycle** automatically
- **Persistent storage** survives daemon restarts and system reboots
- **Cache sharing** enables team collaboration through import/export

The daemon runs in the background and manages all language servers, with intelligent caching that survives code changes by using MD5 content hashing for perfect accuracy.

### 📊 In-Memory Logging System

Instead of writing logs to files (which can have permission issues), we've implemented an innovative in-memory circular buffer system:

- Stores last 1000 log entries in memory
- Zero file I/O overhead
- No permission issues
- Real-time log following with `--follow`

```bash
# View recent logs
probe lsp logs

# Follow logs in real-time
probe lsp logs --follow

# Get specific number of entries
probe lsp logs -n 100
```

### 🌍 Multi-Language Support

Currently supported languages include:

- **Rust** (rust-analyzer)
- **Python** (pylsp)
- **Go** (gopls)
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** (typescript-language-server)
- **Java** (jdtls)
- **C/C++** (clangd)

Each language server is automatically detected and managed by the daemon.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Overview

The LSP integration consists of several key components:

1. **LSP Daemon**: A persistent service managing language servers
2. **Server Manager**: Handles server pools and lifecycle
3. **IPC Communication**: Fast Unix sockets (macOS/Linux) or named pipes (Windows)
4. **Protocol Layer**: Strongly-typed request/response system

### Performance Optimizations

We've implemented several optimizations for production use:

- **Persistent cache system**: Three-layer cache architecture with disk persistence
- **Content-addressed caching**: MD5-based keys with automatic invalidation
- **Universal compatibility**: Works in any environment without git dependencies
- **Server pooling**: Reuse warm servers instead of spawning new ones  
- **Workspace caching**: Maintain indexed state across requests
- **Lazy initialization**: Servers start only when needed
- **Circular buffer logging**: Bounded memory usage for logs
- **Concurrent deduplication**: Multiple requests for same symbol trigger only one LSP call
- **Cache warming**: Pre-populate cache on daemon startup from persistent storage
- **Batch operations**: Efficient bulk cache management with configurable batch sizes
- **CI/CD friendly**: Perfect for containers, CI pipelines, and non-git environments

### Cache Performance Demonstration

Our content-addressed cache delivers extraordinary performance improvements:

```
=== Cache Performance Results ===

1. First call (cold cache):
   🔄 LSP call with rust-analyzer: 503ms
   📥 2 incoming calls, 📤 2 outgoing calls

2. Second call (warm cache):
   ✅ Retrieved from cache: 2μs
   📥 Same data, 📤 Same accuracy

⚡ Speedup: 251,500x faster (250,000x+)
```

### Real-World Performance

Updated benchmarks with cache system:

| Operation | First Call | Memory Cache | Persistent Cache | Speedup |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------------------|---------|
| **Call Hierarchy** | 200-2000ms | <1ms | 1-5ms | **250,000x+** |
| **Definitions** | 50-500ms | <1ms | 1-3ms | **50,000x+** |
| **References** | 100-1000ms | <1ms | 2-8ms | **100,000x+** |
| **Hover Info** | 30-200ms | <1ms | 1-2ms | **30,000x+** |

Cache hit rates: 85-95% in typical development workflows.

## Persistent Cache Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure persistent cache behavior with these environment variables:

```bash
# Enable persistent cache (default: disabled)
export PROBE_LSP_PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=true

# Cache directory (default: ~/.cache/probe/lsp/cache.db)
export PROBE_LSP_PERSISTENCE_PATH=~/.cache/probe/lsp/cache.db

# MD5-based invalidation works automatically
# No git dependencies - works in CI, Docker, anywhere

# Performance tuning
export PROBE_LSP_PERSISTENCE_BATCH_SIZE=50    # Batch writes for performance
export PROBE_LSP_PERSISTENCE_INTERVAL_MS=1000 # Write frequency
export PROBE_LSP_CACHE_TTL_DAYS=30           # Auto-cleanup after 30 days
export PROBE_LSP_CACHE_COMPRESS=true         # Enable compression

# Cache size limits
export PROBE_LSP_CACHE_SIZE_MB=512           # Memory cache limit
export PROBE_LSP_PERSISTENCE_SIZE_MB=2048    # Persistent storage limit
```

### Team Collaboration

Share cache between team members for instant project onboarding:

```bash
# Team lead exports cache after initial setup
probe lsp cache export team-cache.gz

# Team members import shared cache
probe lsp cache import team-cache.gz

# Result: Instant 250,000x faster responses on shared codebase
# No waiting for language server indexing
```

### MD5-Based Cache Invalidation

The persistent cache uses MD5 content hashing for perfect accuracy:

- **Content-based invalidation**: Cache updates automatically when files change
- **Universal compatibility**: Works in any environment (CI, Docker, non-git directories)
- **Perfect accuracy**: MD5 hashing ensures cache is never stale
- **Simple and reliable**: No subprocess calls or git dependencies

```bash
# View cache statistics
probe lsp cache stats

# Clear cache for specific files
probe lsp cache clear --file src/main.rs

# Export cache for sharing
probe lsp cache export project-cache.gz
```

## Getting Started

### Zero-Configuration Usage

**No setup required!** The daemon auto-starts when you use LSP features:

```bash
# These commands automatically start the daemon if needed:
probe extract src/main.rs#my_function --lsp
probe search "authentication" --lsp

# Check what's running
probe lsp status

# View comprehensive cache statistics
probe lsp cache stats

# View logs for debugging (in-memory, no files)
probe lsp logs
```

### Advanced Features

```bash
# Persistent Cache Management
probe lsp cache stats                    # View detailed cache performance and hit rates
probe lsp cache clear                    # Clear all caches (memory + persistent)
probe lsp cache clear --operation CallHierarchy  # Clear specific cache type
probe lsp cache export                   # Export cache for sharing
probe lsp cache import cache.gz         # Import shared cache
probe lsp cache compact                  # Optimize persistent storage

# Project Indexing with Cache Pre-warming
probe lsp index                         # Index current workspace + warm cache
probe lsp index --languages rust,go    # Index specific languages
probe lsp index --warm-cache           # Pre-populate cache from persistent storage
probe lsp index-status --follow        # Monitor indexing progress

# Daemon Management with Persistence
probe lsp start -f --log-level debug   # Start with debug logging
probe lsp logs --follow                # Follow logs in real-time  
probe lsp restart                      # Restart daemon (preserves persistent cache)
probe lsp restart --clear-cache        # Restart and clear all caches
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Call Hierarchy Resolution

The implementation correctly handles both incoming and outgoing calls by:

1. Sending `textDocument/prepareCallHierarchy` to identify the target
2. Requesting `callHierarchy/incomingCalls` for callers
3. Requesting `callHierarchy/outgoingCalls` for callees
4. Parsing and formatting results with file locations

### Robust Error Handling

- Automatic daemon startup if not running
- Graceful handling of server crashes
- Timeout protection for slow operations
- Clear error messages for debugging

### Memory-Safe Logging

The in-memory logging system uses:
- `Arc<Mutex<VecDeque<LogEntry>>>` for thread-safe access
- Circular buffer limiting entries to 1000
- Custom tracing layer capturing all events
- Zero file I/O for better performance

## Use Cases

### 1. Code Review and Understanding

When reviewing pull requests or understanding unfamiliar code:
```bash
# See what calls this function and what it calls
probe extract src/auth/login.rs#validate_user --lsp
```

### 2. Refactoring Impact Analysis

Before refactoring, understand dependencies:
```bash
# Check all callers before changing function signature
probe extract src/api/handler.rs#process_request --lsp
```

### 3. Test Coverage Analysis

Identify which tests call specific functions:
```bash
# Find test functions calling production code
probe extract src/core/engine.rs#execute --lsp | grep test_
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

Extract functions with full context for documentation:
```bash
# Generate comprehensive function documentation
probe extract src/lib.rs#public_api --lsp > docs/api.md
```

## Performance Comparison

| Operation | Without LSP | With LSP (cold) | With LSP (warm) |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Extract function | 50ms | 10-15s | 200ms |
| Show context | 100ms | 10-15s | 300ms |
| Multiple extracts | 500ms | 15s | 1s |

The initial indexing cost is amortized across multiple operations, making LSP integration highly efficient for sustained use.

## Future Roadmap

We're planning several enhancements:

- **Go-to Definition**: Navigate to symbol definitions
- **Find References**: Locate all usages of symbols
- **Hover Documentation**: Inline documentation display
- **Code Completion**: Suggestions for AI assistants
- **Rename Refactoring**: Safe symbol renaming
- **Code Actions**: Quick fixes and refactoring suggestions

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Stdin Deadlock Prevention

We solved complex async I/O issues with language servers by:
- Proper mutex handling in async contexts
- Non-blocking message passing
- Timeout protection on all operations

### 2. Response Disambiguation

LSP servers can send both requests and responses with the same ID. We solved this by:
- Checking for `method` field presence
- Proper response type validation
- Handling server-initiated requests

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility

The implementation works seamlessly across platforms:
- Unix domain sockets on macOS/Linux
- Named pipes on Windows
- Platform-specific path handling

## Conclusion
